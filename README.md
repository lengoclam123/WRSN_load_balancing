# Wireless Sensor Network Load Balancing Project

## Introduction

This project aims to implement load balancing in a wireless sensor network (WSN) with wireless charging capabilities using Python and object-oriented programming principles. The project focuses on optimizing energy consumption and ensuring efficient load distribution among the sensor nodes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lengoclam123/WRSN_load_balancing.git
    cd WSN_Load_Balancing
    ```

2. Install Libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 

Run the main script to start the load balancing simulation:
   ```sh
   python test_network.py
   ```
